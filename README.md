pyuthon
=======

* I just started out learning python. Thought learning git at the same time would get me some market standard skills.
* I keep adding al my exercises here just for learning git, while I can perhaps keep track of my work in python too.
* The repo name is chosen random deliberately so it won't disturb other local processes on my machine.
