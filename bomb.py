# i really liked it
# a python program to blast off a timeed bomb ;-)
# an example of while stmnt
# the flow of execution for a while stmnt is:
	# a. evaluate the condition, yielding True of False
	# b. if the condition is false, exit the while stmnt and continue execution at the next stmnt
	# c. if the condition is true, execute the body and then go back to step 1


n = 10
while n > 0:
	print n
	n = n - 1
print 'Blast Off!!!'
